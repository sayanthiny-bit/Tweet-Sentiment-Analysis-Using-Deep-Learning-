# Tweet Sentiment Classification using LSTM and BiLSTM

## Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying tweets as **Personal Health Mention (PHM)** or **Non-Personal Health Mention (Non-PHM)** using two deep learning models:

* **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Model**
* **BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM) Model**

The performance of both models is compared in terms of accuracy and loss to determine the better model for this specific task.

---

## Technologies & Libraries Used

* Python
* Keras
* TensorFlow
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* scikit-learn

---

## Dataset

* **Training Set**: `phm_train.csv`
* **Testing Set**: `phm_test.csv`
  Each tweet in the dataset is labeled either as `1` (PHM) or `0` (Non-PHM).

## Model Architectures

### 1. LSTM Model

* Embedding Layer (size = 64)
* 2 LSTM layers (output size = 128)
* Dense Layer with Sigmoid activation

### 2. BiLSTM Model

* Embedding Layer (size = 64)
* 1 Bidirectional LSTM Layer (output size = 128)
* Dense Layer with Sigmoid activation

---

## Training Details

* **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy
* **Optimizer**: Adam
* **Metrics**: Accuracy
* **Epochs**: 7
* **Batch Size**: 128

## Results Summary

| Model      | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| **LSTM**   | 98.4%          | 79.04%        |
| **BiLSTM** | 98.6%          | 77.93%        |

* The **LSTM model slightly outperformed** the BiLSTM model on test data (by \~0.6%).
* BiLSTM showed higher model complexity but didn't significantly improve test performance.

## Conclusion

In this specific task, the **LSTM model proved to be the better choice** based on its simplicity and slightly better generalization capability on the test set.
Further tuning and data-specific adjustments may improve BiLSTM performance in the future.
